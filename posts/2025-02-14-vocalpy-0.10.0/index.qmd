I want to write up what's new in 
version 0.10.0 of VocalPy, released at the end of 2024.
Here's an overview:

- [Better workflows for making sound clips and segmenting sound](#sec-sound)
- [A simpler, consistent workflow for feature extraction](#sec-feature-extraction)
- [More example data that's easier to work with](#sec-example-data)
- [Vignettes on using VocalPy with scikit-learn, UMAP, and HDBSCAN](#sec-vignettes)

I'll also give you an overview with this diagram of changes between version 0.9.0 (top ) and version 0.10.0 (bottom).

![Diagram showing changes between versions 0.9.0 and 0.10.0 of VocalPy](vocalpy-0.9.0-0.10.0.svg)

The bottom half of the diagram represents the working model I have of two of the main workflows in VocalPy: 
segmenting sounds and extracting features. 
Below I'll refer back to it, but this post will really focus on improvements and new features. 
I think diagrams like this are really important to help researchers and 
software engineers speak the same language---even when those two groups overlap---
but I'll save my thoughts on how to design software for other posts.

## Bootcamp-driven development

First, some context.
I am feeling good about this release 
because I think it's a pretty solid step forwards for the package.
I'll tell you why that is, 
by giving you a brief rundown of the new features and changes,
with some narrative that you won't get from the 
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md#0100).
You definitely won't get that from the 
[auto-generated release notes](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/releases/tag/0.10.0) 
that GitHub gives us, 
because they consist of the single commit between this version and the last one.
That single commit includes a lot of changes,
that corresponds to this [pull request](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/pull/189), 
cryptically named "Post-NMAC GRC 2024 fixes".

Throughout this post, I'll link to specific issues on GitHub 
that were closed by that pull request, 
to hopefully show you that there's a method to my madness.
About that cryptic name for the pull request:
a lot of the features I added and changes I made 
were after I co-organized and taught 
this [Acoustic Communication And Bioacoustics Bootcamp](https://github.com/vocalpy/acoustic-communication-and-bioacoustics-bootcamp) 
at the 2024 Neural Mechanisms of Acoustic Communication 2024 Gordon Research Seminar
(AKA NMAC GRC 2024, [site here](https://www.grc.org/neural-mechanisms-of-acoustic-communication-grs-conference/2024/)),
together with the always-excellent [Tessa Rhinehart](https://www.tessarhinehart.com/).
(Below I'll call it the ACAB bootcamp for short.)

I want to give a huge, huge thank you to [Nick Jourjine](https://nickjourjine.github.io/) 
and [Diana Liao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QeqBfDMAAAAJ&hl=en) for inviting Tessa and I to teach this workshop. 
I know firsthand how important the skills that we taught are,
especially for graduate students.
It was incredibly gratifying to hear as much from participants in the workshop 
and other organizers of the conference.
If we did nothing else, 
we pointed people to a lot of 
[resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSqPbhUZk8P-8q9_0qSpsMJj8Qbx8q4kAHJw-KBHIwg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.kvttpjnec5kk) 
including the [website](https://rhine3.github.io/bioacoustics-software/) 
with a curated database of bioacoustics software that Tessa has created 
(newly updated just recently with an assist from the research group she's in), 
as well as guides for scientists on programming and computational projects 
that I often point people to when I'm teaching.
I think that computational methods 
in this research area will only continue to become more important 
(although of course I'm biased, and some might say I'm stating the obvious).
I also think Nick has had a lot of foresight 
in connecting these areas of neuroscience to 
what people are doing in bioacoustics more broadly, 
for example with his seminar series ["Bridging Brains and Bioacoustics"](https://www.braincoustics.com/).

Without further ado, here's a rundown of what's new in VocalPy 0.10.0.

### Better workflows for making sound clips and segmenting sound {#sec-sound}

The first set of features and changes 
have to do with two steps we often take 
when we begin any analysis of animal sounds.

Step one is to make clips of the sounds we want to analyze.
Usually you need to do this because your raw data consists of hours of audio, 
e.g., from a recorder deployed in the field for passive acoustic monitoring, 
or in a behavioral experiment where you have a rig set up to start recording any time 
the signal from your microphone goes above some level.
To make this step easier, the `Sound` class now has a `clip` method 
(as planned in [issue #149](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/149))

```python
import vocalpy as voc

sound = voc.Sound.read("big-audio-file-01.wav")

# first clip containing sound of interest
clip = sound.clip(start=0., stop=1.4)
clip.write("big-audio-file-01-clip-01.wav")

# second clip containing sound of interest
clip2 = sound.clip(start=1.4, stop=2.6)
clip2.write("big-audio-file-01-clip-02.wav")
```

Notice in that snippet that we `write` the `clip` to a file. 
That's because it's just a `Sound`; that is, calling `clip` gives you a new `Sound`.
Hopefully, that isn't too surprising, 
but it brings me to the first breaking change: the `Sound` method no longer has a `path` attribute
(as planned in [issue #162](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/162)).
That means that, where before you had 

```python
>>> import vocalpy as voc
>>> voc.Sound.read("samba.wav")
Sound(data=array[0.001, -0.002, ...], samplerate=44100, path="samba.wav")
```

now you have

```python
>>> import vocalpy as voc
>>> voc.Sound.read("samba.wav")
Sound(data=array[0.001, -0.002, ...], samplerate=44100)
```

Why does this matter?  
Because the design of the class no longer implies that a `Sound` is tied to the data found in a file 
at a specific `path`.
This seemingly minor change corresponds to a much bigger change in my mental model of VocalPy 
and how we work with it as researchers.
Again, I'll save a discussion of that 
for another post, assuming you're just here for the "what's new" part,
 not a unified theory of research software engineering.

That brings us to the second step that we frequently do at the start of an analysis: 
segment a sequence of sounds into units, for example, the syllables of birdsong. 
In version 0.10.0, the workflow for this has been significantly improved.
Before I tell you how the workflow has been improved, let me give you a little background.
One common way to segment sound is with signal processing-based methods 
that set a threshold on the audio signal energy, 
and consider any period above the threshold to be a segment 
(like the functions in [`vocalpy.segment`](https://vocalpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/vocalpy.segment.html)).
A cartoon diagram of this sort of method is shown below.

![Figure 1 of TweetyNet paper showing segmentation](lax_63853_elife-63853-fig1-v2.tif.jpg)

More recently it has become common to use statistical models--more precisely, 
neural network models for [sound event detection](https://peerj.com/articles/13152/) 
such as [TweetyNet](https://elifesciences.org/articles/63853) 
and [DAS](https://elifesciences.org/articles/68837).
One thing we have noticed is that there is a gap in the literature comparing approaches to segmenting; 
that's part of what we're trying to make it easier to do (for us and for you). 
This is why we have a 
[`vocalpy.metrics.segmentation`](https://vocalpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/vocalpy.metrics.segmentation.html) 
module.
To make it easier to work with segments and compute these metrics, 
we represent the output of a segmenting algorithm as a data type, 
[`vocalpy.Segments`](https://vocalpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/vocalpy.Segments.html).
(You might know that some researchers also use image processing methods to segment a spectrogram into a set of boxes; 
that's on our [to-do list](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/55))

Now that we're all on the same page about the background, how has the workflow improved? 
The original design had each of the functions in `vocalpy.segment` 
returned a `Segments` instance, that was a container for a `list` of 
separate `Segment` instances as well as an associated `Sound`. 
As of vocalpy 0.10.0, 
the `vocalpy.Segments` class no longer has an instance of a `vocalpy.Sound` associated with it, 
and there no longer is a separate `Segment` class 
(as planned in [issue #154](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/154)).
This is another case where I realized life could be a lot easier by uncomplicating the design of the library 
(and, again, I'll save discussion of that for a separate blog post).
In place of all these tangled-together classes, 
we add a single method to the `vocalpy.Sound` class, `vocalpy.Sound.segment`, 
that takes as its argument a set of `Segments`, and returns a list of `Sound`s
(as planned in [issue #150](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/150)).
You might notice that you could, if you want, `segment` using the `clip` method I just told you about, 
saving each one of the segments you're going to analyze as a `clip`.
Again, without going to deeply into a discussion of software design, 
there's a couple of drawbacks to that approach:
first of all, you will end up taking up a bunch of disk space with duplicated data, 
and second, you will end up with directories full of tiny files 
that are hard to navigate if you end up needing to inspect some of your data 
(and, trust me, you will).
Instead, what you want is to be able to represent the segments themselves as data, 
and then grab the audio clips on the fly.
Yes, there are also good reasons to save intermediate steps in your analysis 
so you don't have to start over from scratch every time you re-run it
---for example, saving spectrograms you generate from the segments of audio---
but that's part of the design discussion I'm glossing over here.
The last thing I added to the `Segments` class was the ability to load a set of segments 
from a csv file, through a `Segments.from_csv` method 
(as planned in [issue #186](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/186)).
I realized during the bootcamp we ran that it's pretty common to save segmentation in csv files, 
e.g., using the Python library Pandas, 
and so we should make it easier to load these.
(VocalPy saves segments in a json file so we can track metadata like the sampling rate of the segmented audio, 
but that's again more detail than I want to get into here.)

Ok, we made it through all the details about segemntation.
Last thing: I want to thank Nick Jourjine (again)--talking with him about this kind of workflow 
really helped me think about how to improve it.

## A simpler, consistent workflow for feature extraction {#sec-feature-extraction}

Once I had simplified the workflow for segmenting sounds, 
I realized I could simplify the workflow for extracting acoustic features from those sounds.
We use a class, `FeatureExtractor`, to represent this generic step in the workflow;
it has an `extract` method that gives you back `Features`.
This `extract` method used to take four different things: 
either a `Sound`, a `Segment` (with its associated `Sound`), 
a `list` of `Sound`s, or a `list` of `Segment`s. 
Obviously, it can't accept a `Segment` or a `list` of them 
if I remove that class.
Good, we can remove some code--that's less to maintain.
I modified the `FeatureExtractor` class to only take in a `Sound` 
or a `list` of `Sound`s
(as planned in [issue #163]()).
I also had some inconsistencies where some functions in [`vocalpy.feature`] 
would return `Features`, and in other cases it was the `FeatureExtractor` 
taking the output of one of those functions and making it into a `Features` instance.
So I fixed that inconsistency 
(as planned in [issue #145](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/145) and [issue #146](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/145)).
Last but not least, I renamed the two feature extraction functions we have right now: 
from the very verbose `vocalpy.features.sat.similarity_features` 
and `vocalpy.features.soundsig.predefined_acoustic_features`, to just 
`vocalpy.features.sat` and `vocalpy.features.biosound` 
(as planned in [issue #190](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/190)).

## More example data that's easier to work with {#sec-example-data}

A crucial part of any scientific Python package is having example data, 
and having it be easy to work with, 
as I found out the hard way during our live demo at the ACAB bootcamp 
(protip: always make sure your code is never implicitly assuming you have access to the internet).
Thankfully, for most of the Jupyter notebooks we worked through in the bootcamp, 
we had asked participants to download data ahead of time.
In VocalPy 0.10.0, you can now download mini-versions of these datasets
(as planned in [issue #183](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/183)), 
so that you can work through these notebooks, 
that are now vignettes in the documentation (see next section of this post).
Additionally, I added single audio files 
to use on the two built-in segmenting methods
(as planned in [issue #182](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/182)).
I also refactored the way examples work, 
again simplifying things (as planned in [issue #185](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/185)).
I'll spare you the details of what I refactored; 
the key idea is that calling `vocalpy.example` with the name of an example 
will now give you back a `VocalPy` data type by default, e.g. a `Sound`. 
Before you got back a path to a file by default, 
and you had to do the work of loading data from that file.
In the case where it's one of the datasets with multiple files, 
you now get back an instance of `ExampleData`, 
a sort of Python `dictionary` where here also the default is 
the value for each key is a list of VocalPy data types.
If you want filenames instead of data types, 
e.g. to demonstrate functionality for loading data from files, 
you can instead specify `path=True`.

## Vignettes on using VocalPy with scikit-learn, UMAP, and HDBSCAN {#sec-vignettes}

One of the goals of VocalPy is to make it easy to do stuff that's specific to acoustic communication research, 
and also get out of the way and make it easy to work with other packages in the scientific Python ecosystem.
In the ACAB bootcamp, we worked through a couple of notebooks that show this in action.
Specifically, we showed how to fit a classifier in scikit-learn, 
and how to reduce the dimensionality of a set of animal sounds with UMAP, and cluster the embeddings from UMAP with HDBSCAN. 
One more thank you to Nick Jourjine, who kindly put together a demo-sized dataset for this second exercise, 
from the much larger [dataset](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.g79cnp5ts) 
that accompanied his [paper](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982223001859) on two types of pup calls in deer mice
(and let's also recognize and thank him for actually sharing the [code](https://github.com/nickjourjine/peromyscus-pup-vocal-evolution) 
that will make it easier for otherss to build on this work!)
In VocalPy 0.10.0, I have added these notebooks as vignettes in the documentation 
[here](https://vocalpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/howto/index.html)
(as planned in [issue #166](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/166)
and [issue #168](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues/168)).
I want to be sure to point out that the scikit-learn vignette is adapted 
from Frederic Theunissen's [BioSound tutorial](https://github.com/theunissenlab/BioSoundTutorial), 
because we're using the [set of acoustic features](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26581377/) built into their `soundsig.BioSound` class
The UMAP vignette is adapted from this helpful [paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.13754) 
by Thomas et al. and the accompanying [code](https://github.com/marathomas/tutorial_repo).
Again, I'm just trying to make what they've done easier for everyone else to do, 
by focusing a little more on the software engineering side of things.

## Stay tuned

Hopefully you have a better understanding of how VocalPy is evolving after reading this post. 
It is now easier to make clips from your raw data, segment your sounds of interest, 
and extract acoustic features from those sounds. 
It's also easier to demonstrate all this functionality with the example data built into VocalPy.
Last but not least, it's easier to see from the docs how you can take what you get out of VocalPy and 
use it with other Python packages like scikit-learn and UMAP-learn. 
Having done this development work, for now I will be focusing on new 
statistical models for jointly segmenting and classifying animal sounds that I'm developing with 
[Yarden Cohen](https://yardencsgithub.github.io/), 
based on [what we're learning about existing models](https://github.com/vocalpy/Nicholson-Cohen-SfN-2023-poster).
(I also want to thank Yarden for continuing our collaboration; 
without him none of this would be possible.)
While I work on those new models and on the next version of VocalPy, we'd love to have your input in our [forum](https://forum.vocalpy.org/).
And of course, if you find a bug or you have your own ideas for features, you can [raise an issue on the VocalPy repo](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy/issues).
