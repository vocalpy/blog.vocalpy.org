    "text": "Hey, it’s me, David.\nI’m the person who develops most of this code.\nHopefully, at some point, a team of much smarter people will work together to develop it, or something like it, once I can convince them that’s a good idea.\nThen finally I can spend more time playing video games, playing guitar, birding, gardening. You know, fun stuff that people who are not open source software maintainers do.\nBut recently I have realized that just writing the code isn’t enough (insert reference to “if you build it, they will come” here).\nSo, okay, fine, we will have a developer’s blog.\nLet me say we have gotten a lot of contributors to at least one package, (vak)[https://github.com/vocalpy/vak?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors-]. I am expecting to get more contributors to our core package [VocalPy], once we share results we are getting with the package right now, using newer features we have added.\nI just released version 0.10.0. I am feeling good about this release because I think it’s a pretty solid step towards the package actually being useful. Let me tell you why that is, by giving you a brief rundown of the new features and changes, with some narrative that you won’t get from the CHANGELOG. You definitely won’t get that from the auto-generated release notes that GitHub gives us, since there’s only one commit, and it points to this pull request, cryptically named “Post-NMAC GRC 2024 changes”. And, it’s a lot of changes.\nSo, context: a lot of the features I added and changes I made were after I co-organized and taught this [Acoustic Communication And Bioacoustics Bootcamp] at the Neural Mechanisms of Acoustic Communication 2024 Gordon Research Seminar, along with the ever-excellent Tessa Rhinehart.\nI want to give a huge, huge thank you to Nick Jourjine and Diana Liao for inviting Tessa and I to teach this workshop. I know firsthand how important the skills that we taught are, especially for graduate students. It was incredibly gratifying to hear as much from participants in the workshop and other organizers of the conference. If we did nothing else, we pointed people to a lot of resources including the website Tessa has created of bioacoustics software (now with input from the research group she’s in) and websites and papers on programming and computational projects that I often point people to when I’m teaching. Obviously I’m biased but I think that computational methods in this research area will only continue to become more important, and I think Nick has had a lot of foresight in linking these areas of neuroscience to what people are doing in bioacoustics."
